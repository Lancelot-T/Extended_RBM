# Extended_RBM

We propose to run the PGM_RBM_Extended program on the databases available in this Git to retrieve the results of our article.

The PGM_Generateurs_Alternatifs program allows us to retrieve the results of the 4 algorithms with which we compare ourselves to test the performance of the RBM.
